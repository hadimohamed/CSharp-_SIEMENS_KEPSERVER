C# Application: Connecting to Siemens S7-1500 PLC via KEPServerEX
This project demonstrates a C# application designed to interface with a Siemens S7-1500 PLC using KEPServerEX as the intermediary communication server. The application utilizes OPC communication to read and write data between the PLC and the application seamlessly.

Features:
OPC Connectivity: Leverages KEPServerEX to communicate with Siemens S7-1500 PLC.
Data Acquisition: Reads and displays real-time data from the PLC.
Control Commands: Sends write commands to manipulate PLC parameters.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for monitoring and control.
Scalability: Easily extendable for additional PLC tags or functionalities.
Requirements:
Siemens S7-1500 PLC
KEPServerEX with Siemens driver configured
.NET Framework or .NET Core compatible environment
Visual Studio for development and debugging
Setup:
Configure your Siemens S7-1500 PLC with KEPServerEX.
Define OPC tags in KEPServerEX corresponding to PLC addresses.
Update the application configuration file with the OPC server details.
Run the application to start monitoring and controlling the PLC.
